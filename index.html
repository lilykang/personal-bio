  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a wonderer and a wanderer. <br />
    I live for conversations that allow me to get to know someone deeply. <br />
    During college, I developed strong passion for entrepreneurship and <br />
    human development through researching internationally and leading student organizations. <br />
    Human Centered Design encapsulates my principles and pursuits. <br />
    After graduating in May 2016, I've been contributing to a software company in Minneapolis, MN
    as a consultant while continuing my involvement in social innovation.
